## General information

Firefox WebExtension project aiming to provide a quick access search area centralizing relevant resources a Genesys engineer might need on a typical day at work.
Similar extension already exists for Chrome, however this was not the case for Firefox.


## Improvements over the chrome extension

 - Smart search on incident-ids / SCR numbers
 - Neater interface following the general aesthetic of the current Genesys branding
 - Loss of dependency on jquery
