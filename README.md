# gensearch-firefox-ext
Firefox extension aiming to make Genesys support engineers life easier.
> This is a quick project built mostly for myself, not much to see here ;)

## What is the aim of this project?

The main goal here will be to provide a quick access search area pointing to every relevant resource a Genesys engineer might need on a typical day at work.

Similar extension already exists for Chrome, however this was not the case for Firefox.

## Features to be aware of
 - Smart search on incident-ids / SCR numbers
